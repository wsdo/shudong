A template for Yii 2 applications based on the
[codemix/yii2-base](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/codemix/yii2-base/) docker image.

 * Ephemeral container, configured via environment variables
 * Testing container for easy testing
 * Optional local configuration overrides for development/debugging (git-ignored)
 * Base scaffold code for login, signup and forgot-password actions
 * Flat configuration file structure
 * Supports docker image based development workflow

The `yii2-base` image comes in three flavours:

 * **Apache with PHP module** (based on `php:7.0.8-apache` or `php:5.6.18-apache`)
 * **PHP-FPM** (based on `php:7.0.8-fpm` or `php:5.6.18-fpm`)
 * **HHVM** (based on `estebanmatias92/hhvm:3.8.1-fastcgi`)

Quickstart
-------------

You need to have [docker](http://www.docker.com) (1.10.0+) and
[docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) (1.6.0+) installed.

```sh
composer create-project --no-install codemix/yii2-dockerized myproject
cd myproject
cp docker-compose-example.yml docker-compose.yml
cp .env-example .env
docker-compose up
# From another terminal window:
docker-compose run --rm web ./yii migrate
```

> *Note:* If you don't have `composer` installed locally you can also use our docker image
> to run composer:
>
> ```
> docker run --rm -v /srv/projects:/var/www/html codemix/yii2-base:2.0.9-apache composer create-project --no-install codemix/yii2-dockerized myproject
> ```

It may take some minutes to download the required docker images. When
done, you can access the new app from [http://localhost:8080](http://localost:8080).

If you see an error about write permissions to `web/assets/` or `runtime/` it's because
the local file owner id is different from `1000` which is the `www-data` user in the container.
To fix this, try:

```
docker-compose run --rm web chown www-data web/assets runtime
```
